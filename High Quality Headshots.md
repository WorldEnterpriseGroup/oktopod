GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) and UFRaw (Unidentified Flying Raw) are two software programs commonly used in image processing and editing. GIMP is a free,
open-source image editing software that allows you to create and manipulate images, graphics, and photos. It supports a wide range of file formats, and its features
include tools for cropping, resizing, retouching, and color correction.

UFRaw, on the other hand, is a free, open-source software that is used for processing raw image files. Raw image files are the unprocessed data that comes directly from 
a digital camera's image sensor, and they contain more information than processed image formats such as JPEG. UFRaw allows you to open and manipulate these raw image
files, adjust the exposure, white balance, and other settings, 
and then export them to another file format such as JPEG or TIFF.
